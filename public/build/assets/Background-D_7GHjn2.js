On the frontend, I use React with Inertia.js to create seamless user experiences. My expertise includes microservices architecture, API development, and WebSocket-based real-time applications. I have hands-on experience in setting up and managing PostgreSQL databases using HeidiSQL, deploying applications with Docker and NGINX, and integrating authentication and authorization mechanisms efficiently. In addition to web development, I am exploring video conferencing technologies, real-time messaging, and gRPC-based communication for high-performance distributed systems.
